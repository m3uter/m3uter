## Disclaimer

This app is in very early stages and still needs a ton of work.

It's entirely possible things are broken, functionality missing, incorrect assumptions made, etc.  

In effect, it's a very early alpha release.

## Legal Disclaimer: Unauthorized Streaming of Copyrighted Content

The use of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) services to access, distribute, or stream copyrighted content without proper authorization is illegal and may result in severe legal consequences. Copyright laws, including but not limited to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States, the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act in the United Kingdom, and similar statutes in other jurisdictions, strictly prohibit the unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or public performance of copyrighted works.

Engaging in the unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content via IPTV services may constitute copyright infringement, which can lead to civil penalties, fines, and potential criminal prosecution. Legal consequences may include but are not limited to:

Civil Liability – Content owners may pursue legal action, leading to significant financial damages and court-ordered injunctions.
Criminal Charges – In some jurisdictions, willful copyright infringement, especially when done for commercial gain, can result in criminal prosecution, fines, and even imprisonment.
ISP Actions – Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may monitor and restrict access to illegal streaming services, issue warnings, or terminate service agreements.
To ensure compliance with copyright laws, users should only access IPTV services that have obtained proper licensing agreements from content owners and rights holders. Engaging with unverified IPTV providers that offer unauthorized access to copyrighted material carries substantial legal and financial risks.

If you are unsure about the legality of an IPTV service, consult with a legal professional or verify its licensing status with relevant copyright authorities.
